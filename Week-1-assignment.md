## Assignment Collaborate on a Shared GitHub Repository Using Git

 
## Instructions:
### Create and Fork a Repository: 
One partner creates a GitHub repository with a markdown file that highlights of learnings from the first week of the workshop. The other partner forks this repository to their own GitHub account.
### Cloning: 
The partner who forked the repository should clone it locally using git clone. This is where you’ll make your contributions to the project.
### Branch Creation: 
Both partners create their own branch using git branch <branch-name> and git checkout <branch-name>. Each partner’s branch should focus on adding their personal reflections on what they learned during the week in a markdown file (e.g., <file-name>.md).
### Making and Committing Changes: 
Add your reflections on what you learned in the markdown file. Use git add . to stage changes and git commit -m "Add <file-name>" to commit them. Your reflections should focus on key takeaways and new skills you've gained.
### Pushing Changes: 
Push your branch to your forked repository using git push origin <branch-name> to share your updates.
Creating Pull Requests: Each partner should open a pull request from their branch in their forked repository to the original repository. In the pull request description, highlight what you've learned and why it's important.
### Reviewing and Merging:
Both partners should review each other's pull requests, leave constructive comments, and once approved, merge the changes into the main repository.
### Syncing Forks:
After merging, sync your fork to the original repository using git fetch upstream and git merge upstream/main to ensure you have the latest version of the project.
### Submission Requirements:
1. Submit links to the original and forked repositories.
2. Include a screenshot of the branches created by each partner.
3. Submit the markdown file with your Learnings from Week 1.
4. Submit a screenshot showing commit history with at least 3 commits from each partner.
5. Provide links to each partner’s pull request, and include a screenshot of the review comments.
6. Submit the final link to the repository with both partners' reflections merged, along with the final commit history.
