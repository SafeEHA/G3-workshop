# Task: Jenkins CI/CD for JavaScript Applications

**Deadline: October 25th, 2024**

In this assignment, you will set up two Jenkins jobs for two different JavaScript applications. This will help you understand both Freestyle and Pipeline jobs in Jenkins.

# CI Pipeline Assignment: Todo List and Counter Apps

## Part 1: Jenkins Freestyle Project for Todo List App

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to [todo-list app](https://github.com/sanoojes/simple-todo-app).
2. Click on the **Fork** button in the top right corner to create a copy in your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Install Jenkins
1. Refer to the official Jenkins installation guide for your operating system: [Jenkins Installation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) or these articles  [Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial-collections/how-to-install-jenkins), [Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-jenkins-on-windows) and [macOS](https://www.jenkins.io/download/lts/macos/) 
2. Follow the instructions to install Jenkins.
3. Once installed, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access Jenkins.

### Step 3: Create a Jenkins Freestyle Project
1. On the Jenkins dashboard, click on **New Item**.
2. Enter a name for your project (e.g., `TodoListApp`) and select **Freestyle project**.
3. Click **OK**.

### Step 4: Configure the Job
1. **Source Code Management**:
   - Under the **Source Code Management** section, select **Git**.
   - In the **Repository URL** field, enter the URL of your forked repository (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-app.git`).
   
2. **Build Triggers**:
   - Check the option **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling** to enable automatic builds when changes are pushed to the repository.

3. **Build Steps**:
   - Click on **Add build step** and select **Execute shell** or **Execute Windows batch command** (depending on your OS).
   - Enter the following commands:
     ```bash
     # Install dependencies
     npm install
     
     # Run tests
     npm test
     
     # Build the application (if applicable)
     npm run build
     ```
   - To archive the build artifacts, click on **Add post-build action** and select **Archive the artifacts**. Specify the files or directories you want to archive (e.g., `dist/**` or any other output folder).

### Step 5: Save and Build
1. Click **Save** to save your configuration.
2. To test your job, click on **Build Now** on the left sidebar.

## Part 2: Jenkins Pipeline for Counter App

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to [counter app](https://github.com/zach7815/JavaScript-Counter).
2. Click on the **Fork** button to create a copy in your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
1. In the root directory of your counter app repository (where your package.json file is located), create a file named Dockerfile with a sample content:
 ```groovy
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]

```
2. Test locally before pushing your changes, you can test the `Dockerfile` locally by running:
```bash
docker build -t yourusername/counter-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 yourusername/counter-app
```
Make sure to update `yourusername` with your actual Docker Hub username.

### Step 3: Create a Jenkinsfile
1. Clone your forked counter app repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/counter-app.git
   cd counter-app
   ```
2. Create a file named `Jenkinsfile` in the root directory of your repository with a sample pipeline like below:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Checkout') {
               steps {
                   checkout scm
               }
           }
           stage('Install Dependencies') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm install' // Use 'bat' for Windows
               }
           }
           stage('Run Tests') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm test' // Use 'bat' for Windows
               }
           }
           stage('Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'npm run build' // Use 'bat' for Windows
               }
           }
           stage('Docker Build') {
               steps {
                   sh 'docker build -t yourusername/counter-app:latest .' // Use 'bat' for Windows
               }
           }
           stage('Docker Push') {
               steps {
                   withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'dockerhub-credentials', variable: 'DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS')]) {
                       sh 'echo "$DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS" | docker login -u yourusername --password-stdin'
                       sh 'docker push yourusername/counter-app:latest'
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job
1. In Jenkins, click on **New Item**.
2. Enter a name for your pipeline job (e.g., `CounterAppPipeline`) and select **Pipeline**.
3. Click **OK**.
4. In the pipeline configuration:
   - Under **Pipeline**, set **Definition** to **Pipeline script from SCM**.
   - Select **Git** as your SCM and enter the URL of your forked repository.
   - Set the **Branch Specifier** to `*/main` (or the default branch name you use).
   - In **Script Path**, set it to `Jenkinsfile`.
5. Click **Save**.

### Step 4: Build the Pipeline
1. To run your pipeline, click on **Build Now** in the sidebar.
